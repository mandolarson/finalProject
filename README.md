# SONG VISUALIZER

I like to focus on music and dedicate time to active listening, so I wanted to make something that would be a fun visual accompaniment to songs I love. I had never heard of FFT before having a deaf classmate recently, and it's so exciting. I barely scratched the surface of what you can do with it here.

This term, I've been challenging myself to draw shapes within my sketches, instead of altering them externally before adding them as assets. This was a fun way to do that! I wanted a subdued, slightly creepy, 1970s vibe to this visualizer, and I think I accomplished that.
